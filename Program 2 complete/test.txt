That year, when Jawad was reproached by his father for sketching a dead person, he leaned at the pomegranate tree located in the tiny garden near the Mghaysil. While sketching the pomegranate tree, he was also baffled as if a quick drawing of a dead person would disturb the deceased in the posthumous life. Is Mr. Ismael wrong for believing that life is the eternal subject of art? It was a collision between an Islamic thinking and the postmodern opinion. During the big Iraqi War and the inner conflict between religion and modern arts, Jawad faced great challenges shared by the same generation. In such a time when ¡°everyone in Baghdad felt like a stranger in his own country¡± (Antoon 174), the Islamic life is not the same Islamic life the Iraqis used to know. The traditional Islam was gradually fading away when the U.S force marched on the Iraq land and the death was stranding on the street. In this period, it seems that god has no grace on the Jihad.
